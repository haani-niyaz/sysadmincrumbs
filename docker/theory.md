> When a container is first instantiated, the user space of the container host makes system calls into the kernel to create special data structures in the kernel (cgroups, svirt, namespaces). 


> when a container is created, the clone() system call is used to create a new process. Clone is similar to fork, but allows the new process to be set up within a kernel namespace. Kernel namespaces allow the new process to have its own hostname, IP address, filesystem mount points, process id, and more. A new name space can be created for each new container â€“ allowing them to each look and feel similar to a virtual machine.
